Day 9: Inheritance and Polymorphism in Python OOP

•	Inheritance: You learned how a child class can inherit properties and methods from a parent class. This promotes code reusability and reduces redundancy.
•	Polymorphism: You explored how different classes can define methods with the same name but provide different implementations. Polymorphism allows for flexibility when designing classes that share similar behavior.
