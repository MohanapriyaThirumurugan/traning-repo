•	File Handling with Pandas: You worked on reading a CSV file using pandas within a class, then accessed the data from another class (or object), and saved the modified data to a new Excel file. This taught you how to:
•	Use OOP to manage file I/O operations.
•	Work with pandas data frames as class attributes.
•	Save manipulated data to Excel using pandas’ to_excel() method
